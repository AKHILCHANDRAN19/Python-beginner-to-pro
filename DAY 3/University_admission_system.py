#University Admission System
#Question: A university has different criteria for admitting students based on their scores in Math, Science, and English:

#The student must have an average score of at least 70 to be considered.
#If the average score is between 70 and 85, the student is admitted if they have scored at least 75 in Math.
#If the average score is above 85, they are admitted directly unless they have scored below 60 in any subject.
#If a student scores above 90 in all three subjects, they receive a scholarship.
